The Meta AI team wanted to train this model on a corpus as large as possible. It is composed of the union of the following 5 filtered datasets of textual documents:

    BookCorpus, which consists of more than 10K unpublished books,

The GALACTICA models are trained on a large-scale scientific corpus. The models are designed to perform scientific tasks, 
including but not limited to citation prediction, scientific QA, mathematical reasoning, summarization, document generation, 
molecular property prediction and entity extraction.

1. Use trucks for last-mile delivery. If heavy-duty
trucks replace regular-size delivery vans for inbound-
stage trucking, Figure 2(b) shows that ﬁve
more areas favor shared mobility, and Table 2 shows
that the total operating cost of the shared-mobility
system decreases by 12.6% from the baseline and
becomes less than the total operating cost of the truck-
only system. This is because,

The best way to reduce emissions in last-mile supply chain is to
increase the carbon cost recovery rates. The carbon cost
recovery rates are the sum of the consumers’ total net
utilities and the retailers’ total proﬁts less the portion
of carbon cost that is not recovered from the consum-
ers and retailers. The carbon cost recovery rates are
the sum of the consumers’ total netutilities and the
retailers�
